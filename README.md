## Getting Started with Your Node.js Application

This repository contains the necessary files to get started with building your Node.js application. Everything is pre-configured and ready for you to customize according to your needs.

### Included Files
- `Dockerfile`: Configuration for building the Node.js application within a Docker container.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Definition for a multi-service Docker application.

### Included Directories
- `myapp`: Includes `app.js` file as Express.js server and `package.json` to specify dependencies for the application.


### Port Mapping
- Port Mapping: `500:80`
  - Maps port 80 within the Docker container to port 500 on the host machine, making the application accessible outside the container.

### Volume Mapping
- Volume Mapping: `/device/absolute/path:/docker/absolute/path`
  - Maps the directory `/docker/absolute/path` within the Docker container to the directory `/device/absolute/path` on the host machine, allowing access to files and directories outside the container.

### Starting the Application
To start the application, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

docker-compose -p network up -d


Feel free to modify and extend the provided configuration to suit your specific requirements.
